## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

## ü§î What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling
developers to build applications that they previously could not.
But using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to
create a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications.

## üìñ Documentation

Please see [here](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)
- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)
- Reference (full API docs)
  Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)

## üöÄ What can this help with?

There are four main areas that LangChain is designed to help with.
These are, in increasing order of complexity:

1. LLM and Prompts
2. Chains
3. Agents
4. Memory

For more information on these concepts, please see our [full documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?).
